data processing notes 

two main files:
Training dataset
Testing dataset

Training data is used to train the model.
Testing data is used to evaluate performance.
This prevents overfitting and ensures generalization.

The dataset contains records of network connections.

Each record is labeled as either:

Normal traffic
Attack (Intrusion)

Typical cleaning steps involved:
Checking for missing values
Verifying dataset consistency
Removing unnecessary columns

Some columns contain categorical values:
protocol type
service
flag
class

definition
1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
TCP is a connection-oriented communication protocol used to transmit data reliably over a network. It ensures that data is delivered accurately and in the correct order between sender and receiver

2. Protocol
A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. It ensures proper communication between devices.

3. DoS (Denial of Service)
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a type of cyber attack where a system, server, or network is flooded with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

4. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
ICMP is a network protocol used to send error messages and operational information about network conditions. It is commonly used for diagnostic tools like ping.
