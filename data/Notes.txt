Objective

    The objective of feature-level exploration was to:
    Understand behavioral characteristics of network traffic.
    Identify discriminative features for intrusion detection.
    Detect skewness, anomalies, and statistical irregularities.
    Prepare features for machine learning modeling.

Dataset Loading

     NSL-KDD dataset successfully loaded into Jupyter Notebook.
     Training and testing datasets imported using pandas.

Initial Data Exploration (EDA) 

    Performed basic exploratory data analysis:
    Checked dataset structure using:
    .head()
    .info()
    .describe()
    Verified data types (categorical vs numerical).
    Checked for missing values.
    Examined class label distribution (Normal vs Attack).

Protocol Analysis

    Analyzed protocol_type column.
    Used value_counts() to observe distribution of:
    TCP
    UDP
    ICMP
    Visualized protocol distribution using plots.
    Observed that TCP traffic dominates the dataset.

Attack Distribution Analysis

    Analyzed class label column.
    Checked frequency of normal vs attack traffic.
    Observed class imbalance.
    Identified dominant attack categories (e.g., DoS-type attacks).

Focused on important features:
    duration - Length of time (in seconds) of the network connection.

    src_bytes - Number of data bytes transferred from source to destination.

    dst_bytes - Number of data bytes transferred from destination to source.

    protocol_type - Kaunsa network protocol use hua connection me.
       TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
       UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
       ICMP

    service -Which network service is accessed.
       http
       ftp
       smtp
       telnet
       ssh
       domain (DNS)

    flag - What is the status of TCP connection.
       SF → Normal connection completed
       S0 → Connection attempt but no reply
       REJ → Connection rejected
       RSTO → Connection reset

Visualization Improvements

    Created clear and structured plots.
    Increased figure size for readability.
    Added proper titles and labels.
    Reduced clutter in graphs.
