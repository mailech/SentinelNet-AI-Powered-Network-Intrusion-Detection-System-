AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

Goal of the Project
1. Develop an AI-based system to detect malicious network traffic.
2.Classify traffic as **normal or attack** using machine learning.
3.Analyze network traffic data and identify patterns.
4.Reduce false alarms while improving detection accuracy.
5.Generate alerts for suspicious activities.

Understanding the Core Problem
1. Modern networks continuously exchange data.
2.Within this traffic, cyber-attacks can occur.
3.Traditional security systems depend on predefined rules.
4.Rule-based systems may fail for new or unknown attacks.
5.Machine Learning helps detect hidden patterns in traffic data.
6.Main task: Traffic Classification (Normal vs Intrusion).

Networking Fundamentals:

1.TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
a) Connection-oriented protocol.
b)Uses 3-way handshake mechanism.
c)Reliable communication.
d) Slower compared to UDP.
e) Widely used in web services.

2.UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
a) Connectionless protocol.
b) Faster transmission.
c)No delivery guarantee.
d)Used in streaming and real-time applications.

3.Other Important Protocols
a) HTTP / HTTPS
b) DNS
c)SSH
d)ICMP

Key Observation:
1.Majority of attacks in the dataset are related to TCP traffic.
2.Fewer attacks observed in UDP and ICMP.

Types of Network Attacks Discussed
1.DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
2.Brute Force Attacks
3.Port Scanning
4.Injection Attacks
5.SYN Flood

Insights from dataset:
1. Attack distribution varies based on protocol type.
2.TCP services are common attack targets.
3.Some attack labels are protocol-specific.

Dataset Understanding
1. Analyzed features such as:
  a. duration
  b.protocol_type
  c.service
  d.flag
  e.src_bytes
  f.dst_bytes
  g.class label

2. Studied:
  a.Distribution of normal vs attack traffic
  b. Relationship between protocol and attack type
  c. Feature correlations
  d. Class imbalance

Multi-Dimensional Analysis Concepts
1.Slicing → Selecting data based on one condition (e.g., protocol = TCP)
2.Dicing → Applying multiple filters (e.g., protocol + duration range)
3. Roll-up → Aggregating data
4.Drill-down → Viewing detailed data
5.Pivoting → Changing data perspective

Purpose:
1. Understand relationships between different categories.
2.Identify patterns between duration, protocol, and attack type.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning
1. Removed duplicate records.
2.Checked missing values.
3.Removed irrelevant or unnecessary features.

Feature Engineering
1. Converted categorical features using encoding.
2.Applied log(1 + x) transformation for skewed features like src_bytes.
3.Normalized numerical features.

Data Preparation:
  1.Split dataset into training and testing sets.
  2.Ensured proper evaluation setup.

Reason:
1.Improve model performance.
2.Avoid bias.
3.Prevent data leakage.
