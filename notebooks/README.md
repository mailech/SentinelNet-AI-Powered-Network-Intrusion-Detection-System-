🚨 AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

 Description

The goal of this project is to build an AI-based Network Intrusion Detection System capable of identifying malicious network traffic and cyber-attacks.

Using Machine Learning, the system will classify network traffic as Normal or Suspicious based on historical data.

🔍 The Project Involves

Processing network traffic data

Preparing and cleaning the dataset

Training machine learning models (later stages)

Detecting anomalies and cyber-attacks

# Milestone 1
📅 Week 1: Project Initialization & Dataset Acquisition

The main focus of this week was understanding the project and the dataset.

✅ Tasks Completed

Defined project goals and expected outcomes

Selected the NSL-KDD dataset

Explored dataset structure and attack categories

Loaded the dataset using Python & Pandas

Performed basic statistical analysis and validation

💡 This step helped in understanding the dataset features and how network traffic data is structured.

📅 Week 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This week focused on preparing the dataset for Machine Learning.

# Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values

Verified duplicate records

Reviewed dataset structure and feature types

⚙️ Data Preprocessing

Converted categorical features into numerical format

Organized and saved cleaned datasets into CSV format

Prepared training and testing datasets

📊 Work Completed
📥 Dataset Handling
