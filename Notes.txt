## 1. Project Goal

The project aims to build an **AI-based system** that detects malicious activities in network traffic and improves network security.

### Objectives

* Detect malicious network traffic
* Classify traffic as **Normal** or **Attack**
* Identify hidden patterns using Machine Learning
* Reduce false alarms
* Generate alerts for suspicious behavior

---

## 2. Problem Overview

* Networks transfer data continuously
* Cyber-attacks occur within normal traffic
* Traditional systems depend on fixed rules
* Rule-based systems fail for unknown attacks
* Machine Learning detects new and hidden attack patterns
* Main task: **Traffic classification**

## 3. Networking Basics

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

* Connection-oriented
* Uses 3-way handshake
* Reliable data delivery
* Slower than UDP
* Common in web applications

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

* Connectionless
* Fast transmission
* No delivery guarantee
* Used in streaming and real-time apps

### Other Protocols

* HTTP / HTTPS
* DNS
* SSH
* ICMP

---

## 4. Key Observations from Data

* Most attacks occur in **TCP traffic**
* Fewer attacks in **UDP** and **ICMP**
* TCP services are major attack targets

---

## 5. Types of Network Attacks

* DDoS Attacks
* Brute Force Attacks
* Port Scanning
* Injection Attacks
* SYN Flood Attacks

---

## 7. Multi-Dimensional Data Analysis

* **Slicing** – Filter by one condition
* **Dicing** – Apply multiple conditions
* **Roll-up** – Data aggregation
* **Drill-down** – Detailed view
* **Pivoting** – Change data view

### Purpose

* Understand feature relationships
* Identify attack patterns

---

## 8. Data Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning

* Removed duplicates
* Checked missing values
* Removed irrelevant features

### Feature Engineering

* Encoded categorical data
* Applied log(1+x) transformation
* Normalized numerical features

### Data Preparation

* Split into training and testing sets
* Prevented data leakage
