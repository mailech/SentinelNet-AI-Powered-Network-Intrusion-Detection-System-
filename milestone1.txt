SENTINELNET – AI BASED NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM
==========================================================

PROJECT INTRODUCTION
--------------------
SentinelNet is an AI-driven Network Intrusion Detection System developed using the NSL-KDD dataset.
The main objective of this project is to automatically identify whether network traffic is NORMAL or MALICIOUS
by analyzing multiple network-related features. The system applies machine learning techniques to detect
cyber-attacks and generate alerts for suspicious activities.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
------------------
1. Develop a machine learning model for intrusion detection.
2. Classify network traffic into Normal or Attack categories.
3. Analyze traffic behavior to detect anomalies.
4. Reduce false alarms while improving detection accuracy.
5. Generate alerts for suspicious network activities.

PROBLEM OVERVIEW
----------------
Modern computer networks continuously exchange large amounts of data. Cyber-attacks can occur during
this communication, making security monitoring essential. Traditional rule-based systems struggle to detect
new or unknown attack patterns. Machine learning provides a data-driven approach by learning patterns
directly from network traffic data.

Main Task:
Traffic Classification (Normal vs Attack)

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED
------------------------
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

DATASET
-------
NSL-KDD Dataset
Files used:
- KDDTrain+.txt
- KDDTest+.txt

MILESTONE 1 – DATA LOADING & PREPROCESSING
-------------------------------------------
SYSTEMATIC FLOW OF WORK COMPLETED:

1. Libraries Imported
   Imported pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and related libraries
   to enable data analysis and preprocessing.

2. Data Directory Creation
   Created a local data/ folder to organize dataset files systematically.

3. Dataset Download
   Downloaded KDDTrain+.txt and KDDTest+.txt from NSL-KDD dataset.

4. Column Name Assignment
   Defined dataset column names explicitly for proper feature understanding.

5. Loading Dataset into DataFrames
   Loaded training and testing datasets using pd.read_csv().

6. Initial Data Inspection
   Used head(), info(), describe(), and duplicate checks
   to understand dataset structure and detect inconsistencies.

7. Missing Value Verification
   Checked for null values to ensure data completeness.

8. Class Distribution Analysis
   Visualized normal vs attack traffic distribution using bar plots.

9. Binary Label Conversion
   Converted multi-class labels into:
      normal = 0
      attack = 1
   to simplify the classification task.

10. Removal of Irrelevant Feature
    Dropped difficulty_level column as it does not contribute to modeling.

11. Categorical Feature Identification
    Identified:
      - protocol_type
      - service
      - flag
    as categorical features.

12. One-Hot Encoding
    Applied pd.get_dummies() to convert categorical data into numerical format.

13. Train-Test Column Alignment
    Ensured train and test datasets had identical feature dimensions.

14. Correlation Matrix & Heatmap
    Generated correlation matrix and heatmap to visualize relationships between features.

DATA VISUALIZATION USED
-----------------------
- Bar chart for protocol distribution
- Histogram for source bytes
- Boxplot for outlier detection
- Heatmap for protocol vs flag analysis
- Correlation matrix for numerical relationships
- Boxplots comparing duration across classes

NETWORKING BASICS
-----------------
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Connection-oriented
- Uses three-way handshake
- Reliable but slower due to verification

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Connectionless
- Faster transmission
- No delivery guarantee
- Common in real-time applications

Other protocols:
HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SSH, ICMP

ATTACK TYPES COVERED
--------------------
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- Brute Force Attacks
- Port Scanning
- Injection Attacks
- SYN Flood

MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS CONCEPTS
-----------------------------------
- Slicing   : Filtering based on one condition
- Dicing    : Applying multiple filters
- Roll-up   : Data aggregation
- Drill-down: Viewing detailed data
- Pivoting  : Changing data perspective

MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE
-------------------------
1. Data Extraction
2. Data Cleaning
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Prediction and Alert Generation

FEATURE ENGINEERING PERFORMED
-----------------------------
- Created total_bytes (src_bytes + dst_bytes)
- Computed src_bytes_ratio for traffic direction analysis
- Calculated packet_rate using count and duration
- Created byte_difference feature
- Converted error flags into binary indicator (is_error_flag)
- Generated same service interaction feature

ENCODING IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------
- One-Hot Encoding for protocol_type and flag
- Frequency encoding for service feature
- Removed original categorical columns after encoding
- Ensured train and test data consistency

EVALUATION METRICS
------------------
Confusion Matrix:
- True Positive (TP)
- False Positive (FP)
- True Negative (TN)
- False Negative (FN)

Performance Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC Curve

Important:
Reducing False Negatives is critical in intrusion detection systems.
