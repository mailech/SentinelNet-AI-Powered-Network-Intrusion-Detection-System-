SentinelNet – AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System
1.Introduction
In this project, I am developing a Network Intrusion Detection system using machine learning.
The main goal is to identify whether network traffic is normal or malicious based on different features in the dataset. 
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a Machine Learning-based 
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) capable of classifying network traffic as either normal or malicious.
The scope of this phase focuses on dataset acquisition, exploratory data analysis, statistical understanding, and preprocessing of network traffic data.
This forms the foundational stage before implementing classification algorithms.

2.Dataset used
For this project, I used the NSL-KDD dataset, which is a standard dataset used for intrusion detection research. 
It contains labeled network traffic records with various features describing each network connection.
The files used:
•	KDDTrain+.txt (training dataset
•	KDDTest+.txt (testing dataset)
After downloading the dataset, I performed the following steps:
Imported the dataset using pandas
Verified dataset dimensions
Examined sample records
Identified feature columns and target label

3.Tools and Libraries Used
•	Python
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib

4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To gain deeper insight into the dataset, I performed systematic exploratory analysis:
Checked data types using .info()
Generated statistical summaries using .describe()
Analyzed class distribution using value counts
Identified categorical attributes (protocol_type, service, flag)
Observed distribution patterns in numerical features
This analysis helped in understanding feature ranges, variance, skewness, and possible feature scaling requirements.

5.Networking Concepts 
To interpret the dataset correctly, I reviewed essential networking fundamentals such as:
TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols
Port-based communication
Packet-level transmission
Connection states and flags
Basic intrusion patterns  

6.Structural Observations 
After performing exploratory operations, the following observations were made:
The dataset contains mixed feature types (categorical and continuous).
Certain numerical attributes exhibit high variance.
Attack distribution is not perfectly balanced across categories.
Some attack types are significantly more frequent than others.
These observations indicate the need for careful preprocessing and possibly class balancing techniques in later stages.

7. Classification of Attack Categories
The dataset includes four major categories of attacks:
 1.Denial of Service (DoS)
 2.Probe
 3.Remote to Local (R2L)
 4.User to Root (U2R)
Each category represents a different attack strategy. For example:
 1.DoS attacks aim to exhaust system resources.
 2.Probe attacks involve scanning and information gathering.
 3.R2L attacks attempt unauthorized access from remote machines.
 4.U2R attacks escalate privileges after gaining initial access.

8. Analytical Insights
From exploratory and statistical analysis, several insights were derived:
Features related to traffic volume (e.g., byte count attributes) show distinguishable patterns between normal and attack traffic.
Categorical features require encoding before model training.
Some features may contribute minimal predictive value and can be evaluated during feature selection.

9.Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
 The following preprocessing steps were performed:
 -Checked for missing values
 -Verified duplicate records
 -Identified categorical and numerical columns
 -Confirmed consistency in label representation
Although the NSL-KDD dataset does not contain null values, validation was performed to ensure dataset integrity.
Future preprocessing steps may include:
Encoding categorical features
Feature scaling
Feature selection

10. Statistical Analysis of Features
Descriptive statistical measures were computed to understand the behavior of numerical attributes, including:
1.Mean
2.Standard deviation
3.Minimum and maximum values
4.Quartile distribution
These measures help in identifying outliers, skewed distributions, and potential normalization requirements.

11. Data Validation and Integrity Verification
To ensure reliability before model training, the following validation checks were performed:
Verified dataset dimensions
Ensured correct labeling of attack categories
Confirmed absence of null values
Checked data type consistency
This validation process ensures that the dataset is structured, clean, and ready for feature engineering and model development.
