SENTINELNET - AI BASED NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM

PROJECT INTRODUCTION
SentinelNet is an AI-driven Network Intrusion Detection System developed using the NSL-KDD dataset. The purpose of this project is to automatically detect whether network traffic is normal or malicious by analyzing various network features. The system applies machine learning techniques to identify suspicious patterns and generate alerts for potential cyber threats.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.Develop a machine learning model for intrusion detection.
2.Classify network traffic as Normal or Attack.
3.Analyze traffic behavior to detect anomalies.
4.Reduce false alarms while improving detection accuracy.
5.Generate alerts for suspicious activities.

PROBLEM OVERVIEW
Modern networks constantly exchange large volumes of data. Within this communication, cyber-attacks may occur. Traditional rule-based detection systems struggle to detect new or unknown attacks. Machine learning provides a data-driven solution by learning patterns directly from network traffic.
Main task: Traffic Classification .  

NETWORKING BASICS

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
.Connection-oriented protocol
.Uses three-way handshake
.Reliable communication
.Slower due to verification

Common in web services
.UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
.Connectionless protocol
.Faster transmission
.No delivery guarantee
.Used in real-time applications

Other Protocols:
HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SSH, ICMP

ATTACK TYPES COVERED
.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
.Brute Force Attacks
.Port Scanning
.Injection Attacks
.SYN Flood

TOOLS USED
.Python
.Jupyter Notebook
.Pandas
.NumPy
.Matplotlib

DATA PREPROCESSING STEPS
1.Imported required libraries.
2.Created data directory to organize dataset files.
3.Loaded NSL-KDD training and testing datasets.
4.Assigned column names for clarity.
5.Performed initial inspection using head(), info(), describe().
6.Checked for duplicate records.
7.Verified absence of missing values.
8.Analyzed class distribution.
9.Converted multi-class labels to binary format.
10.Removed unnecessary features such as difficulty_level.
11.Identified categorical features (protocol_type, service, flag).
12.Applied One-Hot Encoding.
13.Aligned train and test feature columns.
14.Generated correlation matrix and heatmap.

DATA VISUALIZATION
.Bar chart for protocol distribution.

1.Feature Engineering Performed
.Created total_bytes (src_bytes + dst_bytes).
.Computed src_bytes_ratio to analyze traffic direction.
.Calculated packet_rate using count and duration.
.Created byte_difference feature.
